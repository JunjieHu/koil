Matlab Implementation
==

Brief: This is the Matlab implementation of KOIL. Open the Matlab and run the following three scripts in Matlab. You need to prepare the data and the kernel matrix in the same format as those in the data folder.

1. Test the performance of KOIL RS/RS++, FIFO/FIFO++, Infinite_Buffer

		run_demo.m

2. Test the effect of k

		run_demo_Ksize.m

3. Test the effect of buffer size

		run_demo_BufferSize.m

4. Test the multi-kernel learning of KOIL
		
		run_mkl_demo.m
